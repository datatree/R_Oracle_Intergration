# R_Oracle_Intergration
This repository will deal with the intergration of R and RStudio with the Oracle 12c database.
This repository will describe the necessary steps for the installation of four software packages and the configuration of the Window 10 operating system to enable the integration of the different software.  
Software:
1.	R base software (64bit).
2.	RStudio (which is an IDE for R 64bit).
3.	The Oracle 12c client ( 64 bit).
4.	Configuration of the Oracle client and the software environment.
5.	Installation of ROracle driver/package which will allow for a fast native connection to the Oracle database.
